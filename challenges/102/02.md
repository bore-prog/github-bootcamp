# Good commit messages

## What you will learn

- Write half-automated abd scalable commit messages

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 2

We are going to half-automate our git messages with [`git-cz`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

- [ ] Make sure your repo is [commitizen friendly](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly)
- [ ] Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {

  },
  "config": {
    "commitizen": {
      "path": "git-cz"
    }
  },
}
```

- [ ] Use `git cz` to commit your work

It's nice! We have a way to add concistency in our commits‚Ä¶ but from percpective the process a bit too long. We can configure the question to create a faster process.

- [ ] Create a `changelog.config.js` file and paste this

```javascript
module.exports = {
  list: ["test", "feat", "fix", "chore", "docs", "refactor"],
  maxMessageLength: 64,
  minMessageLength: 3,
  questions: ["type", "subject", "breaking", "issues"],
};
```

- [ ] Check the differences and use `git cz` to commit your work

There are [tons of adapters](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#adapters) to align your commit strategy with your build process. Feel free to explore which one looks the best for you.

## üëΩ Bonus

We Automatically [create a `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

- [ ] Add `auto-changelog` to automatically generate changelogs with tags
- [ ] Add a new script `npm changelog`

```json
// package.json

"scripts": {
  ...
  "changelog": "auto-changelog -p && git add CHANGELOG.md",
}
```

Now we need a way to handle the `git tags`

- [ ] `take bin` to create a new folder
- [ ] `touch release` and copy this

```sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "Starting the release: what's your version? Example: 1.0.0"

read next_version
echo ''
echo '==============================='
echo "üî≠ Creating tag $next_version  "
echo '==============================='
echo ''
git tag -a $next_version -m "chore: ü§ñ release $next_version"
```

- [ ] Now you can generate a changelog with `npm changelog`
