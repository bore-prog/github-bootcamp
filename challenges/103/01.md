# Create your first GitHub action

## What you will learn

- Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) solution provided by GitHub.
- You may ask yourself "What is a GitHub action?" [everything is on the `github-actions` documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.1

Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

To create a new workflow:

- [ ] Go to your GitHub repository.
- [ ] Click on the Actions tab.
- [ ] Click on set up a workflow yourself if you want to create a custom workflow, or you can choose a template.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.2

- [ ] Create a new file `.github/workflows/hello.yml`

```yml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.3

- [ ] Commit to your repository to launch the action

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1.4

You can trigger a GitHub Actions workflow on a specific branch by specifying the branch name in the on section of your workflow file.

- [ ] Create another file `.github/workflows/hello-branch.yml`

```yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # This workflow will only run when changes are pushed to the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # This workflow will also run when pull requests are opened to the 'main' branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
```
